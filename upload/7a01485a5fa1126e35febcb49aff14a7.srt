1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:02,670
Visiting a documentation site for any
language

2
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:05,280
or framework can be a little bit daunting.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,090
But the truth is, is that you don't need
to understand all of it.

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,190
We'll be hanging out in several sections

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,750
of the jQuery documentation, during the
jQuery basics.

6
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:18,587
These sections will cover the following
components of the jQuery API.

7
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,690
So there's one set of methods that deal

8
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:25,660
with manipulation and that means changing
the DOM.

9
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,680
So you can change the HTML elements on

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,990
a DOM by either adding them or removing
them.

11
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:37,710
You can update or read the attributes on
an HTML element.

12
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:41,490
And finally you can hide or show elements
or cause some

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:46,450
sort of light transformation effects to
happen and that's manipulation over time.

14
00:00:46,450 --> 00:00:49,390
Another set of methods deal with
Traversing, that

15
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:53,020
means moving around the DOM from element
to element.

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:55,060
How that could mean a parent element to
it's

17
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,560
children all or from the child to the
parent elements.

18
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:04,820
Or sibling to sibling elements, which
means these elements have a common parent.

19
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:08,730
And the final set of methods we're gonna
look at are event methods.

20
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,500
So these tend to deal with keyboard events
or mouse events.

21
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,910
A keyboard event would be a keypress.

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:18,702
A mouse event could be its movement or its
clicks.

23
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:23,220
So, from the jquery.com website, you can
click on the

24
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,090
API documentation to have a look at what
you can do.

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:29,920
Now ,on the left hand side it can be a
little

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,460
bit daunting because there is lots and
lots of sub-categories here.

27
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:36,130
And a lot of these you won't even use.

28
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:40,020
So I'm gonna go over some of these and
categorize them

29
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:43,520
for you see a kind of can get a feel of
what

30
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,350
kind of things you can do and where you
can look

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:52,370
up in your own time when you need to
develop using jQuery.

32
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:55,600
So here we are in the Attributes category.

33
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,610
Now the Attributes category has a list of
methods

34
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:03,490
that you can use to modify the attributes
of elements.

35
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,270
So, an example of an Attribute say on an

36
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,910
anchor or a link would be the href
attribute.

37
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,340
So the href [INAUDIBLE] attribute has the
URL of the link that you wanna go to.

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:18,520
Say that you wanted to get that or even
modify that,

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:21,770
you can use some of these methods here to
do that.

40
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:25,360
So attributes also includes classes as
well so you can add and remove classes.

41
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,440
You can check whether if a element has a
class.

42
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,550
And you can come here to the attributes
and

43
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,380
take a look and use some of the methods
here.

44
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:42,510
Over in the CSS category, this is really
very specific to the CSS of an element.

45
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:47,180
You can change style properties at will,
you could read style properties at

46
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:51,230
will, and you can do the same things like
add classes and remove.

47
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:55,760
Some of these methods are duplicated
throughout different categories

48
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,630
but this once again is a manipulation type
of category.

49
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:07,530
Now Dimensions is handy because you can
check the dimensions of a

50
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:13,190
given element, you can figure out its
height, width or height and width

51
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:18,090
without its Paddings and borders and
things like that, and that can be handy

52
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:23,650
to interrogate when you're doing some
custom animations, or things like that.

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:27,500
Now, dimensions is technically
manipulation, because you're

54
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,920
getting the information of a given thing.

55
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,440
You're not tra, traversing or doing any
event-based stuff.

56
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,810
So, this can be handy to figure out the
dimensions of a particular element.

57
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:46,280
The next category I wanna take a look at
is Effects.

58
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,700
Now effects is basically manipulation over
time.

59
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:55,530
You're doing an animation that may last
several seconds, or you may be

60
00:03:55,530 --> 00:04:01,110
showing, hiding, fading in, fading out,
sliding things in and out.

61
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,440
This all happens over time, so effects is
manipulation over time.

62
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:12,730
Now the next category I want to look at is
Events.

63
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,350
Now, before I click through I'll just want
to

64
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:19,140
have a look at these various different
sub-categories here.

65
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:24,220
So, an event is basically when a user
interacts with a thing.

66
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:29,580
So a user may interact with the keyboard
in a form

67
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,100
using a mouse or scrolling in a browser or
re-sizing a browser window.

68
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:37,910
Also there are special events that are

69
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,840
triggered by the browser itself when
something happens.

70
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,880
So, these are events that are triggered
and

71
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:48,470
then you can do something when that event
occurs.

72
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,920
So that's the kind of things that you need
to keep in mind with events.

73
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:57,140
They can be user-triggered or by the
computer itself it can trigger an event.

74
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,230
So, so if we click on the category of
events, we can see

75
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:04,710
a list of all the kinds of events that you
want to do.

76
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:10,070
Now this isn't very good to look at
necessarily because it includes all

77
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:13,960
the events, so you may want to focus in on
a sub-category of events.

78
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,030
Say if you know that you want to deal with
a mouse movement or something like that.

79
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:20,250
You would look in here.

80
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,370
So these events are often duplicated in
the parent event

81
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:30,010
category so sometimes it's best to look at
the various small

82
00:05:30,010 --> 00:05:33,260
sections of the documentation that you
wanna look at so if

83
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,610
you want to look at the mass events just
do that.

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,510
Now we're gonna take a look at Offset.

85
00:05:38,510 --> 00:05:41,600
Now Offset is very similar to the
Dimensions, is

86
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,090
to figure out the offsets of a particular
element.

87
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:51,060
So, whether if it's from the top of the
left of a parent element or

88
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,600
they, the document as a whole how far it
scrolls like up or left.

89
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,570
These are all handy if you want to trigger
an event for the browser to scroll

90
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,120
back up to the top of a page or down to a
page, things like that.

91
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,880
So, that's the kind of thing that you want
to do here, this is manipulation again.

92
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:14,000
You can query the offset.

93
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,250
And you can actually animate the offset in
some circumstances.

94
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,010
Finally, Traversing.

95
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:27,540
Now, Traversing includes all the methods
that you want to do to actually

96
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,660
move around the document and manipulate
things while you're traversing.

97
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,900
So, if you wanted to get the children of
an element or the

98
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:41,670
closest element with a given CSS light so
you can do things like that.

99
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,700
So Traversing deals with cycling through
elements,

100
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,040
going from the parent to the children,

101
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:54,220
from the children to the parent, or from a
sibling element to its sibling element.

102
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,480
So this is the place you wanna look if
you're doing anything Traversing related.

103
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:03,690
Now there's finally one place that I want
to take you to.

104
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:06,140
And that is Selectors.

105
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,905
So in Selectors you can see all this CSS
type

106
00:07:10,905 --> 00:07:14,870
selectors that you would find from CSS one
through three.

107
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,300
And this is kind of really good to look
at, to

108
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,700
even discover some things that you may not
know about CSS.

109
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:24,800
Now there'll maybe some existing selectors
that you would want to

110
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,100
use when adding behavior but not
necessarily when adding a style.

111
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,270
So this is kind of a new resource to have

112
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,410
a look and it's also got very specific
jQuery selectors.

113
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:38,650
So, you can maybe use this in CSS files

114
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,620
but there's still a selector that jQuery
would recognize.

115
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:46,180
When coding jQuery, think about what
you're doing first.

116
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,029
Are you traversing or manipulating the
[UNKNOWN]?

117
00:07:49,029 --> 00:07:50,650
Are you running events?

118
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,350
Once you've figured out what you're doing,

119
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:55,110
the documentation page won't seem as
daunting.
